# Palouse Prairie Charter School Spring Expedition 2020 Timelines #

Palouse Prarie Charter School is proud to present the following student-curated timelines. Inspired by their work learning about Anna Murray Douglass, and her radical contributions to the better-known work of Frederick Douglass, students undertook these timelines with the goal of researching hidden histories and documenting events and people they found interesting. Each timeline is a little different, but tell its own story of that group's perspective on the subject at hand.

# Anna Murray Douglass  #

This timeline is about Anna Murray Douglass, it shows a few key elements of her life. She was a conductor on the Underground Railroad, the financial master of the Douglass family, and she helped Frederick Douglass escape from slavery. Anna Murray needs a timeline because everyone pays attention to Frederick, and the men of history, however, Anna was the one who helped Frederick escape. This timeline was made by Camas, Felicia, and Alex.

# Idaho Black History Timeline #

The Idaho Black History Timeline was inspired by the lack of a condensed Black history of Idaho. In this timeline, we show some of the most important events and African American people in Idaho. The timeline goes from 1805 to 1914. This timeline was made by Jackson, Ty, Ella, and Isaac.

# Women's History of Idaho #

We are sharing the inspirational history of Idaho feminists. There are a lot of amazing feminists in Idaho's history, some working hard for womenâ€™s rights, others just being downright cool and showing everyone what a girl can do. All of this in little Idaho! This timeline was made by Rohanna, Emelia, and Siabhra.

# Indigenous History of Idaho #

This next topic is about Indigenous people in Idaho, mainly between the 1700s-1900s. We chose this topic because we wanted to talk about the tribes of Idaho and also wanted to put accurate information about it to the internet. We want to make it easier to find a website that gives correct information instead of the wrong answer, a lot of websites have incorrect information about Indigenous people and history. We worked very hard on this topic and there were times when we were not knowing what to do. But in the end, we pulled it off and we hope you like it. This timeline was made by Carmen, Carly, Logan, and Amanda.
